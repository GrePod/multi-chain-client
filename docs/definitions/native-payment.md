# Native payment

Blockchains may support different transactions. Each blockchain has a single currency that is used to pay fees for transactions. This is called the **native currency** of the blockchain (sometimes also called _system currency\_\_). Blockchain may support alternative currencies, which are usually called \_tokens_ and are considered as _application currencies_.

All blockchains we deal with in attestation protocol support addresses which represent sources and targets for native currency transfers.
A **native payment** is a transaction on a blockchain that performs a native currency transfer of funds from one address to another. Specific definitions are provided below for each blockchain we deal with:
