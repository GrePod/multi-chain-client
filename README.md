What is MCC

Mcc or multi chain client is a library used to query blockchain nodes in a unified manner and fetch the data from them as unified data responses as objects that hold all original information one can get form specific node and add static named properties to reposed objects.
Currently we unify [block](./blockObjects/BlockObject.md) and [transaction](./transactionObjects/TransactionObject.md) objects.
